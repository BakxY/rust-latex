**Rust-LaTeX** is a command-line utility written in Rust designed to streamline the process of using LaTeX templates. It allows you to easily copy a template file and automatically fill in basic information based on user input or configuration.

This project serves a dual purpose:

1.  **Practical Utility:** To provide a helpful tool for anyone who frequently uses LaTeX templates and wants to automate the initial setup.
2.  **Learning Rust:** To serve as a learning platform for its author to gain familiarity and experience with the Rust programming language.

## Features

* **Template Copying:** Easily copy a specified LaTeX template file to a new location.
* **Basic Information Filling:** Automatically fill in predefined placeholders within the template with information based on a config file.
* **Simple Command-Line Interface:** Easy to use with intuitive command-line interface.
* **Written in Rust:** Benefits from Rust's performance, safety, and strong tooling.
